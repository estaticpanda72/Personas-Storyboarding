        <h3 > Preparation</h3>
        <p> My chosen interface is the step-to-open trashcan found around Brown's campus. Pictured below</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <p>The step-to-open trashcans are quite intuitive and easily found around Brown's campus. The trashcan attempts to solve the problem of 
            having to touch a contaminated surface when throwing out trash. To do this, it employs a foot pedal that when stepped on 
            opens the disposal chute. A box-like compartment opens up and a user can place their trash inside. Then after depressing the pedal, 
            the compartment closes back up.</p>

        <div>
            <h2> Observations</h2> 
            <u1>
                <li>Users stepped on the pedal with their right foot more than with their left. </li>
                <li>Users who appeared to be in a hurry would ignore the foot pedal and instead use the handle to open the trash can</li>
                <li>Users had a tendency to step hard on the pedal… possibly due to past experience </li> 
                <li>Users kept their foot on the pedal while placing their trash into the trash can</li>
                <li>Users with large trash items needed to shove  their trash into the small compartment and this would prevent the slot from fully closing. 
                    After this, the next user would be unable to use the compartment because the trash would remain. </li>
            </u1>
            <h2> Questions</h2> 
            <u1>
                <li>How did you feel about the rate at which that trash can just opened for you?</li>
                <li>Did you think it was big enough to fit your trash without much effort?</li>
                <li>Was it comfortable to step on the pedal: On a scale of 1-10, how challenging was it to step on the pedal to open the trash can?</li> 
                <li>Was it comfortable to pull on the handle: On a scale of 1-10, how challenging was it to step on the pedal to open the trash can?</li>
                <li>How often do you take the time to actually put recyclable material into the recycling part of the bin?</li>
            </u1>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(132, 122, 122)"> Responses Summary</h2> 
            <u1>
                <li>Overall the rate at which the trash can opened wasn’t an issue to the people I interviewed. 
                They did note that they believed the compartment opened up was too narrow to comfortably place trash into. 
                They had to almost approach placing the trash inside from a particular angle</li>
                <li>The pedal itself was not as wide as it could be.  Users felt the pedal should extend more so a whole foot would press on it.</li>
                <li>Interviewed users had no issues with the handle. The average difficulty rating for pulling the handle was 2. </li>
                <li> The general consensus was that even though the recycling side was right next to the trash side, 
                users didn’t always make the effort to separate their waste material into the appropriate bin due to the awkward nature of having 
                to step to open one bin and then step again.</li>

                Description: Joan is a sophomore student who works a part time job along with doing
                research at Brown. In her space time, she advocates for sustainable
                practices and being conscious of the environmental impact one has.<br>
                Interface Problem: Joan has a packed schedule so she's always in a rush. 
                She might find it difficult to take time to make use of the recycling section 
                of the trashcan when in a hurry.<br>
                Joan represents users I interviewed who are either very busy and have a packed schedule or enviornmentally conscious

                Description:"Kyle is a senior varsity soccer coach at Brown University. 
                He's approximately 5'4 and has a broken right arm.<br>
                Interface Problem: Kyle is short with a broken right arm. This makes it difficult 
                for him to access the trash compartment without
                needing to reposition himself at a certain angle.<br>
                Kyle represents a user that I interviewed who is short and also another user who has an arm injury. </figcaption>
